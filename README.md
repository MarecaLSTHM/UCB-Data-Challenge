# UCB-Data-Challenge

This data repository serves as a code and data management tool for Team UCB.

The final scripts that produce the figures in the team report are placed in the **R Production** folder and the script files are named as (Figure X.R)
to correspond with each figure.

Data from the data sources identified in the report as well as data resulting from transforming this data or data for producing the graphics is 
placed in the **folder named data**.

**R folder** has the development scripts or code that we used to try and get the visualisations we ended up with. The code or scripts in this folder may be hard to follow or 
use to reproduce any output.

The **output folder** stores all the output data in particular the images with the graphs used in the team report.
